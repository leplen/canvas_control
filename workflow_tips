If you want to edit the game.json file directly, it helps to cp a version of the file, then make a change in the editor, and then diff the outputs to see how it's mapping.
The json is pretty straight-forward to read, but only if you've already used the GUI editor as many parameters are stored in position based arrays corresponding to the
UI layout in gdevelop instead of being in key:value pairs.
